### For prospective students
I am constantly seeking high quality, motivated graduate students interested in computer vision thesis projects. Please be aware that I require all my students to successfully complete the Introduction to Computer Vision graduate course ([<font color="SkyBlue">22928</font>](https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/22928.htm "Computer Vision graduate course")), as well as an advanced seminar -- either as part of the group seminar ([<font color="SkyBlue">22955</font>](https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/22955.htm "Advanced group seminar")) or as a written seminar ([<font color="SkyBlue">22949</font>](https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/22949.htm "Advanced written seminar")). This, before beginning to work on their thesis.
