For prospective students:
====
I am constantly seeking high quality, motivated graduate students interested in computer vision thesis projects. Please be aware that I require all my students to successfully complete the Introduction to Computer Vision graduate course (22928), as well as an advanced seminar -- either as part of the group seminar (22955) or as a written seminar (22949). This, before beginning to work on their thesis.
