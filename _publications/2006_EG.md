Abstract
------
We present a system for automatically generating custom, structured image-maps for input depth-maps. Our system thus allows quick fitting of masses of objects with tailor-made image-maps. Given a depth-map of a novel 3D object, our method tiles it with intensities from similar, pre-collected, textured objects. These are seamlessly merged to form the new image-map. This process is performed by optimizing a well defined target likelihood function, via a hard-EM procedure. We present results for varied object classes including human figures, and fish.
