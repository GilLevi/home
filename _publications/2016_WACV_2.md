<b>Figure 1. Visualization of the LATCH descriptor</b>. Given an image patch centered around a keypoint, LATCH compares the intensity of three pixel patches in order to produce a single bit in the final binary string representing the patch. Example triplets are drawn over the patch in green and blue.

Abstract
------
We present a novel means of describing local image appearances using binary strings. Binary descriptors have drawn increasing interest in recent years due to their speed and low memory footprint. A known shortcoming of these representations is their inferior performance compared to larger, histogram based descriptors such as the SIFT. Our goal is to close this performance gap while maintaining the benefits attributed to binary representations. To this end we propose the Learned Arrangements of Three Patch Codes descriptors, or LATCH. Our key observation is that existing binary descriptors are at an increased risk from noise and local appearance variations. This, as they compare the values of pixel pairs: changes to either of the pixels can easily lead to changes in descriptor values and compromise their performance. In order to provide more robustness, we instead propose a novel means of comparing pixel patches. This ostensibly small change, requires a substantial redesign of the descriptors themselves and how they are produced. Our resulting LATCH representation is rigorously compared to state-of-the-art binary descriptors and shown to provide far better performance for similar computation and space requirements.

What is LATCH?
------
LATCH is a fast and compact binary descriptor used to represent local image regions. LATCH was shown to obtain better performance on standard benchmarks than other pure binary descriptors, sometimes matching the accuracy of far larger floating point representations such as SIFT. Its extraction time is only slightly longer than other binary descriptors and far faster than floating point representations. See the LATCH paper below for further details.

LATCH is now part of the OpenCV [xfeatures2d](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/xfeatures2d) library, since version 3.0. 

LATCH won the CVPR 2015, [OpenCV State of the Art Vision Challenge](http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/VisionChallenge), in the Image Registration category.
