Abstract
------
Action Recognition in videos is an active research field that is fueled by an acute need, spanning several application domains. Still, existing systems fall short of the applicationsâ€™ needs in real-world scenarios, where the quality of the video is less than optimal and the viewpoint is uncontrolled and often not static. In this paper, we consider the key elements of motion encoding and focus on capturing local changes in motion directions. In addition, we decouple image edges from motion edges using a suppression mechanism, and compensate for global camera motion by using an especially fitted registration scheme. Combined with a standard bag-of-words technique, our methods achieves state-of-the-art performance in the most recent and challenging benchmarks.

**The Motion Interchange Patterns (MIP) representation**. (a) Our encoding is based on comparing two SSD scores computed between three patches from three consecutive frames. Relative to the location of the patch in the current frame, the location of the patch in the previous (next) frame is said to be in direction i (j); The angle between directions i and j is denoted alpha. (b) Illustrating the different motion patterns captured by different i and j values. Blue arrows represent motion from a patch in position i in the previous frame; red for the motion to the patch j in the next frame. Shaded diagonal strips indicate same alpha values.
